 This project implemented with 
-a 555 timer
-an acs712 current sensor
-resistors and capacitors of your choise in order to create a pulse
-the uno board that prints the meausurments and sends them to serial port
The matlab file is used in order to plot in real time the waveforms of both current and voltage just like the oscilloscope
